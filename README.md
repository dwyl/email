# Send Email > Gmail

Send email from any Node.js app using Google (Gmail)

## Why?

We have been using Mandrill for sending email @dwyl
and we made a node module for this: https://github.com/dwyl/sendemail

However we have had requests from *clients* to send email via Gmail.
And have implemented this:

*However* ... the amount of *setup* required to use Mandrill is quite
*daunting* to beginners.
