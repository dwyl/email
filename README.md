## Why? ü§∑‚Äç

We needed a way to keep track of email in our App.
To know precise stats for deliverability, click-through and bounce rates
in real-time so that we can monitor the "health" of our
[feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback).
This is our quest to do that.



## What? üí≠

An email dashboard for our App.

## Who? üë§

Right now we are building this App _just_ for our own (_internal_) use. <br />
As with ***everything*** we do,
it's **Open Source** so others can learn from it.


## How?


### 1. Copy over the Migration Files from the MVP

In order to speed up our development of the **`email`** App,
we are _only_ going to create _one_ schema/table. (_see: step 2_)


See: [github.com/dwyl/email/commit/bcafb2f](https://github.com/dwyl/email/commit/bcafb2fbd92782b1e166305428c5211690374b2e)

#### _Why_ reuse migrations?

Our objective is to be able to run the **`email`** App in several ways:
1. **Independently** from any "main" App.
So the **`email`** dashboard can be 100% anonymised
and we just display _aggregate_ stats for all email being sent/received.
2. **Inside** the "main" App.
If we don't want to have to deploy _separate_ Apps,
we can simply include the **`email`** functionality within a "main" App.
3. **Umbrella App** where the **`email`** App is run as a "child" to the "main".

By reusing the **migration** files from our "main" App,
(_the files need to have the **exact same name** and contents_),
we maintain full flexibility to run our **`email`** App in any way.
This is because if we run the migrations against the "main" PostgreSQL DB,
the migrations with those timestamps will _already_ exist
in the **`migrations`** table; so no change will be required.
However


### 2. Create the `sent` Schema/Table

In order to store the data on the emails that have been sent,
we need to create the **`sent`** schema:

```elixir
mix phx.gen.html Ctx Sent sent message_id:string person_id:references:people request_id:string status_id:references:status template:string
```

When you run this command in your terminal,
you should see the following output:

```
* creating lib/app_web/controllers/sent_controller.ex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/edit.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/form.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/index.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/new.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/show.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/views/sent_view.ex
* creating test/app_web/controllers/sent_controller_test.exs
* creating lib/app/ctx/sent.ex
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20200224224024_create_sent.exs
* creating lib/app/ctx.ex
* injecting lib/app/ctx.ex
* creating test/app/ctx_test.exs
* injecting test/app/ctx_test.exs

Add the resource to your browser scope in lib/app_web/router.ex:

    resources "/sent", SentController

Remember to update your repository by running migrations:

$ mix ecto.migrate
```

We will follow these instructions in the next step!


In case you are wondering what the **`message_id`** and **`request_id`** fields
in the **`sent`** schema are for.
The **`message_id`** is,
as you would expect,
the _Globally Unique_ ID (GUID)
of the message in the AWS SES system.
All SNS notifications will reference this.

The [`aws-ses-lambda`](https://github.com/dwyl/aws-ses-lambda) function
returns a response in the following form:
```js
{
  MessageId: '010201707927184a-e45eb814-3721-43cb-ac70-f527a9907055-000000',
  ResponseMetadata: {
    RequestId: 'd876bd28-4962-4eea-b7c4-17703b113279'
  }
}
```

Or when invoked from Elixir
see:
[github.com/dwyl/elixir-invoke-lambda-example](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-invoke-lambda-example)
the response is:
```elixir
{:ok,
 %{
   "MessageId" => "010201703dd218c7-ae82fd07-9c08-4215-a4a9-4b723b98d8f3-000000",
   "ResponseMetadata" => %{
     "RequestId" => "def1b013-331e-4d10-848e-6f0dbd709434"
   }
 }}
```


### 3. Add the SentController Resources to `router.ex`

Open the
`lib/app_web/router.ex`
file
and locate the section that starts with
```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
```
Add the following line in that scope:

```elixir
resources "/sent", SentController
```




### 4. Run the Migrations


In your terminal run the migrations command:

```sh
mix ecto.migrate
```





### _Required_ Environment Variables

Running this app or its' tests on your local machine will require
that you set a few
[*environment variables*](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

Using your terminal or text editor, create your `.env` file.  
Then *paste* this *sample* into your `.env` file:

```txt
JWT_SECRET=WhatEverYouWant
```


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
