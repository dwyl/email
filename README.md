## Why? ü§∑‚Äç

We needed a way to keep track of email in our App.
This is our quest to do that.



## What? üí≠

An email dashboard for our App.




## Who? üë§

Right now we are building this App _just_ for our own (_internal_) use. <br />
As with ***everything*** we do,
it's **Open Source** so others can learn from it.


## How?



### _Required_ Environment Variables

Running this app or its' tests on your local machine will require
that you set a few
[*environment variables*](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

Using your terminal or text editor, create your `.env` file.  
Then *paste* this *sample* into your `.env` file:

```txt
JWT_SECRET=WhatEverYouWant
```


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
