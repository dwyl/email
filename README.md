## Why? ü§∑‚Äç

We needed a way to keep track of **`email`** in our App.
To know precise stats for deliverability, click-through and bounce rates
in real-time so that we can monitor the "health" of our
[feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback).
This is our quest to do that.



## What? üí≠

An **`email` analytics dashboard**
and supporting parsing function for our App.

## Who? üë§

Right now we are building this App
_just_ for our own (_internal_) use
[`@dwyl`](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/267). <br />
As with ***everything*** we do,
it's **Open Source** so others can learn from it.


## How?

If you just want to _run_ the **`email`** App,
simply **`git clone`** this project:




### Deploy the Lambda Function

# TODO: FINISH [SNS Parser PR](https://github.com/dwyl/aws-ses-lambda/pull/4) !!




<br /> <br />

### Want to _Understand How_ we Made This? ü§∑‚Äç

If you want to _recreate_ the **`email`** app from scratch,
follow all the steps outlined here.

If you are adding the **`email`** functionality
to an _existing_ App,
you can **skip** to **step 2**.
If you are creating an **`email`**
functionality and dashboard from scratch,
follow steps 0 and 1.

### 0. Create a New Phoenix App üÜï

In your terminal, run the following mix command:

```elixir
mix phx.new app
```

That will create a few files.
e.g: [github.com/dwyl/email/commit/1c999be](https://github.com/dwyl/email/commit/1c999be3fff75e42fcb6e62e1f2a152764ce3b74)

Follow the instructions in the terminal to download all the dependencies.

At this point the **`email`** App
is just a basic "hello world" Phoenix App. <br />
It should be familiar to you
if you have followed any of the Phoenix tutorials, <br />
e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example
or https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial



### 1. Copy the Migration Files from the MVP üìã

In order to speed up our development of the **`email`** App,
we are _only_ going to create _one_ schema/table; **`sent`** (_see: step 2_).
Since our app will refer to email addresses,
we need a **`people`** schema which

See: [github.com/dwyl/email/commit/bcafb2f](https://github.com/dwyl/email/commit/bcafb2fbd92782b1e166305428c5211690374b2e)


#### _Why reuse_ migrations?

Our objective is to be able to run the **`email`** App in several ways:

1. **Independently** from any "main" App.
So the **`email`** dashboard can be 100% anonymised
and we just display _aggregate_ stats for all email being sent/received.

2. **Inside** the "main" App.
If we don't want to have to deploy _separate_ Apps,
we can simply include the **`email`** functionality within a "main" App.

3. **Umbrella App** where the **`email`** App
is run as a "child" to the "main" app.

By reusing the **migration** files from our "main" App,
(_the files need to have the **exact same name** and contents_),
we maintain full flexibility to run our **`email`** App in any way.
This is because if we run the migrations against the "main" PostgreSQL DB,
the migrations with those timestamps will _already_ exist
in the **`migrations`** table; so no change will be required.
However


### 2. Create the `sent` Schema/Table üì§

In order to store the data on the emails that have been sent,
we need to create the **`sent`** schema:

```elixir
mix phx.gen.html Ctx Sent sent message_id:string person_id:references:people request_id:string status_id:references:status template:string
```

When you run this command in your terminal,
you should see the following output
showing all the files that were created:

```
* creating lib/app_web/controllers/sent_controller.ex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/edit.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/form.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/index.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/new.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/templates/sent/show.html.eex
* creating lib/app_web/views/sent_view.ex
* creating test/app_web/controllers/sent_controller_test.exs
* creating lib/app/ctx/sent.ex
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20200224224024_create_sent.exs
* creating lib/app/ctx.ex
* injecting lib/app/ctx.ex
* creating test/app/ctx_test.exs
* injecting test/app/ctx_test.exs

Add the resource to your browser scope in lib/app_web/router.ex:

    resources "/sent", SentController

Remember to update your repository by running migrations:

$ mix ecto.migrate
```

We will follow these instructions in the next steps!

#### Why So Many Files?

When using `mix phx.gen.html` to create a set of phoenix resources,
the files for the migration, context, controller, views, templates
and tests are generated.
This is a _good_ thing because Phoenix does all the work for us
and we don't have to think about any of the "boilerplate" code.
It can feel like a lot of code
especially if you are new to Phoenix,
but don't get hung up on it.
Right now we are only interested in the _migration_ file:
[`/priv/repo/migrations/20200224224024_create_sent.exs`](https://github.com/dwyl/email/blob/master/priv/repo/migrations/20200224224024_create_sent.exs)


Feel free to read through the other files created in step 2:
[github.com/dwyl/email/commit/b8d4b06](https://github.com/dwyl/email/commit/b8d4b062f2bd358d35395e0dafd252f2bb3d5be8)
The code is fairly straightforward,
but if there is ***anything*** you **_don't_ understand**,
[***please ask!***](https://github.com/dwyl/email/issues)

We are not doing much with these files in the next few steps,
but we will return to them later when work on the dashboard!



#### What are the `message_id` and `request_id` fields for?

In case you are wondering what the
**`message_id`** and **`request_id`** fields
in the **`sent`** schema are for.
The **`message_id`** is,
as you would expect,
the _Globally Unique_ ID (GUID)
for the message in the AWS SES system.
We need to keep track of this ID because
all SNS notifications will reference it.
So if we receive a "delivered" or "bounce" SNS notification,
we need to match it up to the original **`message_id`**
so that our data reflects the **`status`** of the message.

The [`aws-ses-lambda`](https://github.com/dwyl/aws-ses-lambda) function
returns a response in the following form:

```js
{
  MessageId: '010201703dd218c7-ae82fd07-9c08-4215-a4a9-4b723b98d8f3-000000',
  ResponseMetadata: {
    RequestId: 'def1b013-331e-4d10-848e-6f0dbd709434'
  }
}
```

Or when invoked from Elixir
see:
[github.com/dwyl/elixir-invoke-lambda-example](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-invoke-lambda-example)
the response is:

```elixir
{:ok,
 %{
   "MessageId" => "010201703dd218c7-ae82fd07-9c08-4215-a4a9-4b723b98d8f3-000000",
   "ResponseMetadata" => %{
     "RequestId" => "def1b013-331e-4d10-848e-6f0dbd709434"
   }
 }}
```

We are storing `MessageId` as `message_id`
and `RequestId` as `request_id`.


### 3. Add the SentController Resources to `router.ex`

Open the
`lib/app_web/router.ex`
file
and locate the section that starts with
```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
```
Add the following line in that scope:

```elixir
resources "/sent", SentController
```

e.g: [/lib/app_web/router.ex#L20](https://github.com/dwyl/email/blob/db1abd0cc075d27b7cd2bfc37019fc33dd5d0585/lib/app_web/router.ex#L20)


### 4. Run the Migrations


In your terminal run the migrations command:

```elixir
mix ecto.migrate
```

You should expect to see outpout similar to the following:

```
23:15:48.568 [info]  == Running 20200224224024 App.Repo.Migrations.CreateSent.change/0 forward

23:15:48.569 [info]  create table sent

23:15:48.574 [info]  create index sent_person_id_index

23:15:48.575 [info]  create index sent_status_id_index

23:15:48.576 [info]  == Migrated 20200224224024 in 0.0s
```

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

ERD after creating the **`sent`** table:

![erd-with-sent-table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/75200073-b6944700-575c-11ea-97c9-a7b495395a05.png)


### Checkpoint: Run the App!

Just to get an idea for what the `/sent` page _currently_ looks like,
let's run the Phoenix App and view it. <br />
In your terminal run:

```elixir
mix phx.server
```

Then visit: http://localhost:4000/sent
in your web browser. <br />
You should expect to see:

![visit-sent-in-browser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/75242300-b8432680-57bf-11ea-80ae-d84a1195e69c.png)

Click on the "New sent" link to create a new **`sent`** record.
You should see a form similar to this:

![new-sent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/75242477-16700980-57c0-11ea-83c9-66c3d2a1c307.png)

Input some test data and click "**Save**". <br />
You will be redirected to: http://localhost:4000/sent/1
with the message "**Sent created successfully**":


![created-successfully](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/75242487-1bcd5400-57c0-11ea-82c1-9aacb04fa1d3.png)

_Obviously_ we are not going to create
the **`sent`** records _manually_ like this. <br />
(_in fact we will be disabling this form later on_) <br />
For now we just want to know that record creation is working.

If you return to the http://localhost:4000/sent (`index`) route,
you should see the one "sent" item:

![sent-showing-one-record](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/75242625-62bb4980-57c0-11ea-9865-7bd81dc230ee.png)

This confirms that our `sent` schema is working as we expect.


#### Run the Tests!

For good measure, let's run the tests:

```elixir
mix test
```

You should expect to see output similar to the following:

```sh
11:23:09.268 [info]  Already up
...................

Finished in 0.2 seconds
19 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 448418
```

19 tests, 0 failures.

#### Test Coverage!

Follow the
[instructions to add code coverage](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#15-what-is-not-tested). <br />
Then run:

```sh
mix coveralls
```

You should expect to see:

```sh
Finished in 0.2 seconds
19 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 938602

```

We think it's _awesome_ that Phoenix creates tests
for all the functions generated by the `mix gen.html`. <br />
This is how software development should work!

With that checkpoint completed, let's move on to the _fun_ part!


### 5. Parse and Insert SNS Notification Data

The _magic_ of our **`email`** dashboard
is knowing the _status_ of each individual message
and the _aggregate_ statistics for _all_ messages.
Luckily AWS has our back here.

If you are unfamiliar with Amazon Simple Notification Service
([SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)),
it is a managed service that can send notifications to any other system.
In our case the only notifications we are interested in
are those that relate to the **`email`** messages
we have sent using AWS Simple Email Service (SES).

We _could_ configure AWS SNS
to send all SES related notifications
directly to our **`email`** (_Phoenix_) App,
however that has a potential downside:
[DDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

When we create an API endpoint
that allows inbound POST HTTP requests,
we need to consider _how_ it can (_will_) be _abused_.

But rather than _subscribing_ directly to the notifications

### _Required_ Environment Variables

Running this app or its' tests on your local machine will require
that you set a few
[*environment variables*](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

Using your terminal or text editor, create your `.env` file.  
Then *paste* this *sample* into your `.env` file:

```txt
JWT_SECRET=WhatEverYouWant
```


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
